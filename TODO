A list of known issues in no particular order:

 - Code that compiles templates is duplicated in two places
 - We re-compile templates on every request without caching
   results. Seems wasteful.
 - Handlebars plugins are registered for the homepage only.
 - We seriously need to optimize how we use methods that
   cause DOM reflows.

Planned/ongoing projects:

 - Add support for dashboards where you can display multiple
   charts.
 - Replace templates.js with Handlebars
 - Introduce u-classes
 - Use system fonts

Blockers for the next release (jQuery removal):

 - Popover fading logic is commented out in Chart.js
 - When you click to edit a color popover disappears
 - Whatever TKs are still in the code
